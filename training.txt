Use (Logistic Regression)
    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
After importing split x and y
Split  the data around 20%-80% between testing and training stages.
We have the test dataset(or subset)in order to test our modelâ€™s prediction on this subset.
Let Positive be (P), Negative be (N) , True Positive be (TP) , False Negative be (FN), True Negative be (TN), False Positive be (FP).

perform Fit and predict operation   
    from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
